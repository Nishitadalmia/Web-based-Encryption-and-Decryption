# Web-based-Encryption-and-Decryption
This project provides secure text encryption and decryption using AES encryption and QR code-based multi-factor authentication. It encrypts text with AES, then encodes both the AES key and ciphertext into QR codes for secure storage and transfer. The decryption process requires scanning the QR codes to retrieve the key and message.
